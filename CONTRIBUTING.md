# Contributing

When you want to write code for the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Claim the ticket: Tell us that you want to work on a certain ticket, we will assign it to you (We don't want two people to work on the same thing ;) )
2. Fork your feature branch from the `development` branch (not the `master` branch)
3. Write an acceptance test: Describe what you want to do (our integration tests touch the database)
4. Implement it: Write a unit test, check that it fails, make the test pass â€“ repeat (our unit tests don't touch the database)
5. Write documentation for it.
6. Check with `rake` that everything is fine and send the pull request to the `development` branch :)

## How to get started developing

Getting started is easy, just follow these steps.

### In a nutshell

* Clone the project.
* `cd` into the folder and run `bundle` 
* `rake` and see all tests passing (you need to have ArangoDB installed for that)
* Happy coding!

### Detailed description

Make sure you are running Ruby 1.9.x (or JRuby/Rubinius in 1.9 mode) and clone the latest snapshot into a directory of your choice. Also make sure ArangoDB is installed and accessible via `arangod` (for example by installing it via `brew install arangodb`).

We encourage you to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/). If you do so, a gemset for the project is created upon changing into the directory. If you do not use `rvm` nothing special will happen in this case. Don't worry about it.

Change into the project directory. Run `bundle` to get all dependencies (do a `gem install bundler` before if you don't have bundler installed).

Now you can run `rake` to see all tests passing (hopefully). Happy coding!

You can also start up yard for documentation: `rake yard:server`

### Guard

Guard is a tool for comfortable development. If you want to use it for development, you have to first start an instance of ArangoDB and then start guard with `guard`. This will:

* Run a documentation server on `http://localhost:8808`
* Run `bundle` whenever you change the dependencies
* Run the integration and unit tests whenever you change a file in the lib or spec directory
