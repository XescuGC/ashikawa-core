It provides low level access and will be used in different ArangoDB ODMs and other projects related to the database. It is always working with the stable version of ArangoDB, this is currently version **1.3**. If you want to access an ArangoDB instance running version **1.2** or use Ruby 1.8 refer to version [0.7](https://github.com/triAGENS/ashikawa-core/tree/0.7) of this gem (or just update ;) ).\r\n\r\nAll tests run on Travis CI for the following versions of Ruby:\r\n\r\n* MRI 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and 2.0.0\r\n* Rubinius 1.9 mode\r\n* JRuby 1.9 mode\r\n\r\nWe also run on JRuby and MRI Head, but they are allowed failures (Please see [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/triAGENS/ashikawa-core) for their build status).\r\n\r\nPlease note that the [`master`](https://github.com/triAGENS/ashikawa-core) branch is always the stable version released on Ruby Gems and documented on RDoc. If you want the most recent version, please refer to the [`development`](https://github.com/triAGENS/ashikawa-core/tree/development) branch.\r\n\r\n## How to Setup a Connection\r\n\r\nWe want to provide you with as much flexibility as possible. So you can choose which adapter to use for HTTP (choose from the adapters available for [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday)) and what you want to use for logging (basically anything that has an `info` method that takes a String). It defaults to Net::HTTP and no logging:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndatabase = Ashikawa::Core::Database.new do |config|\r\n  config.url = \"http://localhost:8529\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut you could for example use Typhoeus for HTTP and yell for logging:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"typhoeus\"\r\nrequire \"yell\"\r\n\r\nlogger = Yell.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\ndatabase = Ashikawa::Core::Database.new do |config|\r\n  config.url = \"http://localhost:8529\"\r\n  config.adapter = :typhoeus\r\n  config.logger = logger\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a detailed description on how to use Ashikawa::Core please refer to the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/triAGENS/ashikawa-core/master/frames). An example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndatabase[\"my_collection\"] # => Returns the collection my_collection – creates it, if it doesn't exist\r\ndatabase[\"my_collection\"].name = \"new_name\"\r\ndatabase[\"new_name\"].delete\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Issues or Questions\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug in this gem, please report it on [our tracker](https://github.com/triAGENS/ashikawa-core/issues).
